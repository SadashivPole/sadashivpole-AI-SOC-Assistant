AI SOC Assistant
============================

AI-powered SOC Assistant 
_A smart security tool that allows analysts to query SIEM logs using natural language, auto-generate queries, and visualize results for faster investigations._

---

Description
---------------
The **AI SOC Assistant** is an open-source project designed to simplify Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows.  
Instead of writing complex SIEM queries manually, analysts can type **natural language questions**, and the assistant will automatically generate queries, run them, and visualize the results.

This project is aimed at:
- Security analysts looking to save time during investigations  
- SOC teams wanting to standardize query building  
- Students and researchers exploring AI-assisted cybersecurity

 Features
-----------
* **Natural Language Queries** ‚Äì ask in plain English, get SIEM queries automatically.  
* **Log Visualization** ‚Äì interactive charts and tables for faster analysis.  
* **Investigation Chat** ‚Äì chat-based interface for guided triage.  
* **Authentication** ‚Äì Single Sign-On (SSO) support.  
* **Scalable Design** ‚Äì modular architecture that can connect to different SIEM backends.
