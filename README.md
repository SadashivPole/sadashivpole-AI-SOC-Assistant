The **AI SOC Assistant** is an open-source project designed to simplify Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows.  
Instead of writing complex SIEM queries manually, analysts can type **natural language questions**, and the assistant will automatically generate queries, run them, and visualize the results.

This project is aimed at:
- Security analysts looking to save time during investigations  
- SOC teams wanting to standardize query building  
- Students and researchers exploring AI-assisted cybersecurity
